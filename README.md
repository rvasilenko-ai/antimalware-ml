Materials for ML in Anti-Malware class

## Acknowledgments 
Thanks to Andrew Ng for his amasing materials to learn Machine Learning and Deep Nearal Network:
* [Machine Learning (by Standford at Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
* [Deep Neural Networks (by deeplearning.ai)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
* [TensorFlow in Practice (by deeplearning.ai)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice)

Even though I was in and out studing AI and using ML before that, these classes really made me to fall in love with ML and DNN.

A lot of ideas used in section came while studing an amazing materials for the book
[Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781491962282/) by Aurélien Géron.
You can find  series of Jupyter notebooks that walk you through the fundamentals of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in python using Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow here as well:
