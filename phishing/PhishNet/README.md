# PhishNet

To detect phishing pages, we could use a multi-class learning and train NN to take a screenshot for the page as input and return a phishing target as an output. 

The problem with such approach is that in reality we have millions of different web sites, and even though there is a limited number of phishing targets, there would be still thousands of different classes which would make NN extremely slow to train, as well as require a complete retraining everytime we would want to add a new class. 
Another problem is that we only have a very few (in come cases just one) examples of each web page, while classic supervised training requires a lot of training examples to produce good results.

# Smarter Hashes
To resolve these issues, we will use Deep Nearal Networks not to classify web pages, but instead to generate embeddings, smarter hashes, to convert images to. The smarter hashes of similar images will be similar as well, but in comparison with phash we explored in notebook <put name of notebook here>, we will try to make smarter hashes to both generalize (so one hash covers more similar images) and separate (hashes for different web-sites are further apart) better.

### Saimese Netowrk and One-Shot Learning
The first approach is based on a **[one-shot learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96b_weTZb2w)**. 
This approach allows us to efficiently traing a DNN even if you have only one training example per each class.

### Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
The second appraoch is based on **[Autoencoders and GANs](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/17_autoencoders_and_gans.ipynb)**.
