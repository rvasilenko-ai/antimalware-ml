# PhishNet

## Overview
As you have learnt already, there are pretty efficient ways to use image hashes, a perception hash in particular, to not only recognize that a web page is phishing, but also label it based on what known page it is similar to. 
However, even though pHash is pretty efficient to recognize similar images, there are weaknesses as well: it is gray scale based and it reacts pretty badly if an image is even slightly shifted or zoomed. That makes pHash easier for an adversary to evade. 

Luckily for us, there are better ways to recognize similar images then just image hashes.
In this section you will learn how to use Deep Neural Networks for this purpose.

## Transfer learning

## Siamese Neural Networks and One-Shot Learning
Even though the Transfer learning is quite efficient technique to use pre-trained classifier CNN which is already able to recognize a lot of features in images, to detect phishing pages, it has a main limitation - it requires labelled data to fine-tune. 
There are thousands of different phishing targets which would make NN slow to tune, as well as require a complete retraining every time we would want to add a new target. 
Also, as you have learned from previous exercises, the labelled data doesn't come for free and might be labor intense to produce.
Since phishing pages are changing regularly and that might be a problem by itself.

Another problem is that we only have a very few (in come cases just one) examples of each web page, while classic supervised training requires a lot of training examples to produce good results.

Instead, we will use another approach called **[one-shot learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96b_weTZb2w)**. 
It allows us to efficiently train a DNN even if you have only one training example per each class, and doesn't require every page to have a label.

#### Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
Another approach which doesn't require labeled data at all is **[Autoencoders and GANs](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/17_autoencoders_and_gans.ipynb)**.
